# CommonScripts
all scripts, procedures, commands for limit setting, various fit tests

Please commit what you have first and then we will do some clean-up

1. SOB plot (Joosep)

2. impact plot, the whole procedure and actual commands(Robin)

3. scripts to produce plot/table for final limit and best fit value for mu

4. check BDT input/output using post-fit (scripts from Gregor?)

5. the whole unblinding procedure(the steps and commands, I can do it based on Matthiasâ€™ slides)

6. fit stability studies(all 5 of them, scripts/commands, Karim, Gerrit, Jasone?)

7. scripts to make the event yield tables(subtlety the agreed way to handle the errors) the scripts should run on the limit input root files

8. scripts to make the both the pre-fit and post-fit final discriminant plots using the input root file or the root file coming out of maximum likelihood fit

9, converge on naming patterns for the data card

10. data card making script
